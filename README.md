# Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository contains a console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java.
The game is designed to be played between two players, taking turns to mark their symbols ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid.
The program ensures valid moves, checks for a win or a draw, and displays the current state of the board after each move.
